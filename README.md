# Image-Processing

## Noise filter implementation
    Write functions using your preferred programming language to implement the following noise filters.  You must pass all filter parameters as inputs to the function (i.e. pass as value or reference parameters).  The function must be optimized for the fastest execution time.
    
    1. Mean filter
    
    2. Median filter
    
    3. k-closest averaging
    
    4. threshold averaging
    
## JPEG Compression assignment

## Final image processing project assignment
    You must carry out the following image-processing tasks using your own programs.  Use of library functions/external code should be limited to loading, saving image files, and carrying out basic matrix operations.
    
    Step 1: Load the given sample image (sampleimage.png) from the file and convert it into greyscale, 8bpp format.
    
    Step 2: Enhance the image to the best possible quality by applying the following operations.
    
    a.     Noise filtering
    
    b.     Contrast stretching
    
    c.      De-blurring (sharpening)
    
    d.  Any other image enhancement operation that you may think appropriate
    
    You should try at least two different filters/algorithms for each stage. Save the output obtained with each algorithm and compute the SNR resulted by each filter/algorithm.
    
    Step 3: Plot the histogram of the final image.
    
    Step 4: Compute the entropy of the image and the best achievable compression ratio compared to compared to 8bpp gray-scale representation.
